# Sam-Personal-Site
This repository is for my html static personal page.

This repository is what I used to learn basic HTML, CSS and Javascript 
from the very beginning. All my interest and passion aboutweb development
start from here. Thanks to @joeyzhang1989, who guided and instructed me
through all this. Also he taught me how to work as a programmer and work
with others using git bash command line system, this repository records every
progress I made through this project.

Features: 
1: Contain 3 pages of contents introducing myself;

2: Include Github heatmap in the Contact Page;

3: Built a Contact form for message input.
