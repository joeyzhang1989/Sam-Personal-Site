# Sam-Personal-Site
This repository is for my html static personal page.

This repository is what I used to learn basic HTML, CSS and Javascript 
from the very beginning. All my interest and passion about
web development start from here. Thanks to @joeyzhang1989, who guided and 
instructed me through all this.

Features: 
1: Contain 3 pages of contents introducing myself;
2: Include Github heatmap in the Contact Page;
3: Built a Contact form for message input.
